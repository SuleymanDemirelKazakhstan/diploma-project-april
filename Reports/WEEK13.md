* At 13 weeks, I conducted testing on the site.  While testing the site, I found some errors in the interface and during filtering. For example, the old filtering code took a lot of time during startup, also in my opinion the frontend part needed improvement. And I decided to talk about it with the Project manager, then during the group meeting we decided the Frontender would do the site improvement, and in filtration I will try to use the hash set function.
