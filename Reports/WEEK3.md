+ Meeting with members and mentor
  + We held an online meeting with our mentor OLIMZHON BAIMURATOV. During the online meeting, he told the problem in the field of Sciensation citation about publications. Teachers spend a lot of time collecting information about publications from various sources . We have conducted research and have not found sites that would provide a solution to this problem. We have found sites that help in creating a portfolio or that collect publications from a single source. And we decided to create a website that collects a list of publications and creates a portfolio.
