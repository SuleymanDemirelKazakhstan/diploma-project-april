## Alternative / Market research 
We held an online meeting with our mentor OLIMZHON BAIMURATOV. During the online meeting, he told the problem in the field of Scientation citation about publications. Teachers spend a lot of time collecting information about publications from various sources . We have conducted research and have not found sites that would provide a solution to this problem. We have found sites that help in creating a portfolio or that collect publications from a single source. And we decided to create a website that collects a list of publications and creates a portfolio.

## Goals
Developing web application/ web scraping system for automatisation process of bibliometric data collection. 
Create a web page that will create a portfolio of publications from different sources. The website will collect a list of references and bibliometric information.

## User personas 
SDU  STAFF & Researchers

## Non-functional requirements
The website will automatically collect a list of references and all bibliometric information about publications from various sources: such as Scopus, Scolap, IEEEXplore, Science direct. 
And after preparing the portfolio, we should be able to export the document as CSV or PDF. And also during the export, there should be a single standard template in the document.
The WEBSITE should work in all modern browsers, work well and look good on all screen sizes.


## Risks 
Our project is being done during a pandemic and there is a risk that a participant from our team may get sick, at this time we will need to replace him or finish his work.


## Future iterations
If the SDU accepts our project (website), then there will be a link to our website on the official website.
In the future, we want to make a system for collecting user projects and also add a number of copyrights to the user.
We want users of other universities to also be able to use our product (website).
